16S rDNA Amplicon Analysis
Samples were analyzed using Mothur (Schloss, 2009) Version 1.36.0.  Specifically, analysis was performed using a standard MiSeq workflow developed at Vantage (https://github.com/scholzmb/VantageMothur/BranchABC*).  For a complete listing of commands, please see the github link.  Briefly, reads were assembled, checked for PCR duplicates,
